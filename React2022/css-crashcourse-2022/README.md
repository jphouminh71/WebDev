#### What is HTML? 
HTML is a langauge that we use to develop front end applications to create beutiful websites. 

**HtmlElement**: A term we use that signifies anything that we can add to the website. Every element must contain a opening tag and a closing tag.  Extra spaces are ignored in HTML. 

#### What is CSS? 

CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it allow us to style our html elements. Usually when you need to find a specific way to style something you just end up looking it up. 

**Box Model**
    Margin: Controls the space around the border of the element
    Padding: Controls the spacing of all the elements inside of an element. Prefer using padding as opposed  to height and width as it adjusts dynamically. 
    Border: surrounding outline of the item 

In summary, the box models says that and element has controls for controlling the amount of space of the containing items inside of the component (padding) and control for controlloing how much space an element needs to have around it (margin) and every element has a border that can be specified.
