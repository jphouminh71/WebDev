# React
---
These notes are coming from Angela Yu's tutorial on Udemy

* React is a front end framework that focuses on building component based UI's. Makes structuring your front end code super easy. Previously we focused on keeping js,html,css away from each other, but react takes a different approach and encourages bring them together.
* It enables websites to be incredibily interactive because you can make components update themselves and talk to the server independently. So instead of designing interaction for an entire page we just focus on the smaller components. 
* React is also a lot more effiencent because it only updates elements that have changed. 
* This is one of the fastest growing and in demand front end frameworks.

### JSX

* Next Gen Javascipt that allows you to do things like write pure html in javascript files and then write javascript in the html. It pretty much modernized the way javascript is written these days
<br>

* Pretty much you should learn how to code in JSX because its a new standard for web dev.

### JSX Imports and Exports 
* Look at your examples on code sandbox, pretty straight forwards.
